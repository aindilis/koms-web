Text browsing assistant for affordances on typed entities via modular proxy 

A derivative of AlleyOop system.  KOMS Web uses entity typing to
markup entities found in web pages and other URI, and presents the
user with menus for actions to perform on these entities.  This avoids
having to write browser plugins.

Trying and failing to get a Perl-based http/https rewriting proxy
going, so that I can markup recognized entities with type-appropriate
link menus, and other annotations.

This worked in the past, but isn't working now.  Copied from AlleyOop
code.
