(fix the \' -> ' issue)
(come up with an entity typing system)

(add the ability for page-wide links to act on the current page,
 add to the top or bottom, say, mark page read, etc.)

(should have it connect to remove system)
(should have it be able to pass the annotated text via the link,
so like if it is { Free Life Planner } have it do
https://frdcsa.org/koms?action=archive&name=Free%20ELife%20EPlanner)
()

(have to fix it annotating HTML links, use AlleyOop filter copy
 properly then)

(it goes Firefox (MITMProxy Cert) -> MITMProxy -> HTTPS Website -> MITMProxy -s -> koms-web.py -> XMLRPC -> UniLang -> KOMSWeb (UniLang Agent) -> UniLang -> XMLRPC -> koms-web.py -> MITMProxy -> Firefox)

('KOMSWeb (UniLang Agent)' does the rewriting)
